## atoi function

*Requirements*
* int atoi(string pStr)
* if pStr is null return 0
* if pStr contains non-numeric characters return 0
* better yet if found 123x, return 123
* assume all numbers are positive
* + and - signs can be considered non-numeric
* assume there are no inbuilt string to integer conversion functions available
* you may assume ASCII
