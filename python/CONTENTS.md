Here I do my best to describe the things that live in this directory.

## trailing zeroes

*Requirements*
* how would you count the number of trailing zeroes in !100 (100 factorial)?

## count the filled dots

*Requirements*

* To apply for the job opening you must apply through the [link](http://apply.dataprocessors.com.au/)
* The link displays a matrix of dots, some of them hallow, some of them filled.
* The task is to fill in the proper jobcode, and the correct number of filled dots in the field provided. Simple enough--but you have to do all these in less than a second.
* Obviously, this required a script to accomplish. I created a script using python but did not met the under a second requirement. It was always 1.XX seconds. A dude in StackOverflow used the same approach but implemented it in Java always got it under a second. 

For this to work you need to `pip install selenium`
